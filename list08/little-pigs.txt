Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who set out to build their own houses.
The first little pig built his house out of straw. It was easy and quick, but not very strong.
The second little pig used sticks. It was better than straw, but still not very sturdy.
The third little pig built his house out of bricks. It took a long time, but it was very strong.
One day, a big bad wolf came along. He blew down the straw house and the stick house,
but he could not blow down the brick house. The pigs were safe, and they lived happily ever after.
